It was once the Jewish quarter of Madrid. Its main center of activity and meeting place was the Synagogue, located on the site where today is the Church of San Lorenzo. Its name, Lavapies, has its origin in the Jewish tradition of washing before their prayers. The plaque that gives its name to Lavapiés Street illustrates the fountain that once stood in the square and two people washing in it. It is home to dozens of nationalities. In its streets coexist people from distant corners of the planet and you can hear many different languages. Its streets are narrow and old. One of the most characteristic elements of the Lavapiés neighborhood is the Corrala del Sombrerete, one of the few remaining in Madrid. Built in 1872, it was declared a National Monument.

We welcome you to Spain and we wish you a good stay in Madrid!

Oscar works as a photographer and Vanessa is an actress and theatre producer (during 2017 I became mum, so I won't be doing check in's for a while). However, until some years ago Oscar was an engineer and Vanessa was a M&A lawyer. And then one day we decided to turn our lifes up side down and follow our real passions.

We are best friends and on May 2012 we decided to move forward and enroll in a small business together. Vanessa had been hosting with Airbnb for 2 years by then (renting the spare room at her place in Madrid/Milan and her apartment in Barcelona) and her experience (upgraded to Superhost in early 2011) was so positive that we decided we could also help other owners that don't live in town or don't have the time to rent their properties to travelers as you. And this is what we are doing now together. 

More about us, we love to travel: Vanessa has travelled 4 out of the 5 continents with a backpack that has been with her for 25 years now and enrolled in a new adventure in spring 2017: becoming a mum. Life had still not so pleasant surprises and in september 2021 she was diagnosed a breast cancer and is still in treatment. Conversely, Oscar travels by bike and closer to Madrid, so as often as he can he takes his bike for a short trip in the mountains (he's really fit!). He has also spent several summers working in France. As the business grew, we took more people on board, a lot since 2012 we must say, and each of them have left their impromt in our company. Now the team is composed by Mica, an Argentinian girl now based in Madrid for a few years, also keen on travels and on exploring new places. Mica is full of energy and we love her smiley caracter. And last but not least, Julia, who joined us in in February 2023. Julia is Mica's friend, also Argentine and has a super cool and fun vibe.

We are also keen in meeting new people and learning new things from them, but more importantly, we want you to feel at home at any of our apartments and that you feel that there's someone in town who cares for you:-) 

We enjoy little life pleasures like riding our bicycles or growing our small organic vegetables gardens, spending time with friends, our dogs and Vanessa's daughter (the only mother of the team!). We like eco-friendly environments since we care a lot about our planet. 

We will help you to find you like home in this beautiful city and we look forward to having the opportunity to meet you soon!!

Though I'm a digital designer by profession, I love interior design and took the chance to renovate my mother's decades-old apartment during a trip back so she could live more comfortably. As you can imagine it wasn't an easy task, try telling your parents to throw that old clock stuck at ten to eleven or that weird looking boat that's supposed to bring luck into the family. But we worked out something in the end and I got to take down some walls, placed a new floor that keeps the house super cool in summer, and basically changed all the furniture in the house. 

That boat stayed on though. ;P

My mother is based in Madrid and has been working as a local tour guide for VIP groups from Asian countries and brings them all over Spain, sometimes even to Morocco, Portugal and France. Though tiring she loves her job and meeting people. My sister and I don't stay in Spain normally so she's happy to have company with at the apartment if she's not away on tour.

We welcome you to Spain and we wish you a good stay in Madrid!

Oscar works as a photographer and Vanessa is an actress and theatre producer (during 2017 I became mum, so I won't be doing check in's for a while). However, until some years ago Oscar was an engineer and Vanessa was a M&A lawyer. And then one day we decided to turn our lifes up side down and follow our real passions.

We are best friends and on May 2012 we decided to move forward and enroll in a small business together. Vanessa had been hosting with Airbnb for 2 years by then (renting the spare room at her place in Madrid/Milan and her apartment in Barcelona) and her experience (upgraded to Superhost in early 2011) was so positive that we decided we could also help other owners that don't live in town or don't have the time to rent their properties to travelers as you. And this is what we are doing now together. 

More about us, we love to travel: Vanessa has travelled 4 out of the 5 continents with a backpack that has been with her for 25 years now and enrolled in a new adventure in spring 2017: becoming a mum. Life had still not so pleasant surprises and in september 2021 she was diagnosed a breast cancer and is still in treatment. Conversely, Oscar travels by bike and closer to Madrid, so as often as he can he takes his bike for a short trip in the mountains (he's really fit!). He has also spent several summers working in France. As the business grew, we took more people on board, a lot since 2012 we must say, and each of them have left their impromt in our company. Now the team is composed by Mica, an Argentinian girl now based in Madrid for a few years, also keen on travels and on exploring new places. Mica is full of energy and we love her smiley caracter. And last but not least, Julia, who joined us in in February 2023. Julia is Mica's friend, also Argentine and has a super cool and fun vibe.

We are also keen in meeting new people and learning new things from them, but more importantly, we want you to feel at home at any of our apartments and that you feel that there's someone in town who cares for you:-) 

We enjoy little life pleasures like riding our bicycles or growing our small organic vegetables gardens, spending time with friends, our dogs and Vanessa's daughter (the only mother of the team!). We like eco-friendly environments since we care a lot about our planet. 

We will help you to find you like home in this beautiful city and we look forward to having the opportunity to meet you soon!!

Osca, Vanessa, Mica and Julia

Vivimos durante varios años en la Plaza Mayor y allí estábamos felices, con un montón de planes a nuestro alrededor, con la tranquilidad de cualquier hogar de puertas para adentro y el bullicio de Madrid con sólo abrir los balcones.

Nuestra familia fue creciendo y tuvimos que cambiarnos de casa, pero como teníamos mucho cariño a nuestro apartamento, decidimos compartirlo con otros viajeros que quisieran conocer el encanto de Madrid.
 
¡Desde los balcones del apartamento se podía disfrutar de una de las plazas con más vida del mundo! Era 2013 y nacía Plaza Mayor Deluxe.

Todo al principio fue una aventura, la reforma, imaginar cómo decorábamos el apartamento, qué equipamiento dejábamos dentro, electrodomésticos, cómo contactábamos con la gente que quisiera alquilarlo…Lo que sí teníamos muy claro es que nuestro fin último es que los invitados que se alojaran en nuestro apartamento se sintieran como en casa.

Entonces llegó nuestra primera reserva... y luego otra y otra más… la gente no sólo venía una vez, sino que ¡muchos querían volver!
Fue cuando nos encontramos con un problema, ¡no teníamos días libres! (vaya problema, ¿verdad?). No en serio, nos daba mucha rabia que la gente que íbamos conociendo y que se iban convirtiendo en amigos quisieran venir a Madrid y no tuviéramos un lugar para ellos. Así que nos liamos la manta a la cabeza y empezamos a trabajar con más apartamentos. En el 2015 nacía Romantic, también en la Plaza Mayor, ideal para parejas. Este apartamento tiene ventanales dan a un patio interior con lo cual se puede disfrutar de los planes de la Plaza Mayor y la tranquilidad y el silencio de un patio privado. 

En el 2016 se nos presentó la oportunidad de gestionar dos apartamentos más y allá que nos lanzamos! Uno de ellos está también en la Plaza Mayor, es el apartamento de más capacidad (hasta 5 personas), lo llamamos Family. El otro está muy cerca de Plaza de España y desde sus ventanales se ve completamente el Palacio Real, las vistas de día y de noche cuando se ilumina el Palacio son espectaculares. Sencillamente impresionante!

El último, por el momento, es Elegance y lo inauguramos en Marzo de 2017. Es un apartamento espectacular, tiene dos habitaciones y en la habitación principal hay dos balcones desde los que se ve la Plaza Mayor, un salón gigante y un cuarto de baño enorme con ducha y bañera. ¡Todo lujo y elegancia!

Lo mejor sin duda de estos años ha sido la cantidad de gente estupenda que hemos ido conociendo, con ellos hemos ido creciendo y ahora tenemos amigos por todo el mundo!

Madrileña de nacimiento. Vivo y trabajo en Madrid aunque he viajado por países de Europa, Centro y Sur América y Norte de África. Mi destino pendiente: Asia. Hablo Español, Portugués y me defiendo con el Inglés.

Estudié Educación Social y comencé Antropología Cultural. Viví durante un tiempo en Brasil, dónde estudié parte de esta apasionante carrera, la cuál de momento, no he llegado a terminar.
Me dedico a la intervención social con personas sin hogar, en alojamientos institucionales. Un trabajo que considero interesante y desde el que creo se aprende mucho; Sobre todo a nivel de respeto y convivencia, del trato entre personas desde el lado más humano y cómo resolver problemas desde la creatividad y el ingenio.

Intento meditar, procuro pintar y hacer manualidades y me gusta mucho bailar. He hecho danza oriental durante años, aunque ahora la tengo un poco abandonada. También he sacado mi lado más artístico a flote haciendo cursos de clown y poniendo en escena a algún personaje.

Me gusta mucho cocinar. Para mí y para los demás. He hecho cursos profesionales y disfruto enseñando la preparación de platos típicos de nuestra región, aunque me gusta elaborar recetas de cualquier parte del mundo (por lo menos las que conozco).

En mis ratos libres disfruto dando un paseo, visitando los mercados y parques del barrio en el que vivo o teniendo una buena conversación mientras se toma una cerveza con una buena tapa o un chocolate con churros. Esos pequeños-grandes placeres de la vida, de los cuáles creo que se puede gozar en Madrid, sin gastar mucho y si lo conoces un poco. Dar un paseo por el Rastro de Madrid, ir a un concierto o ir al teatro.
Creo que soy de esas personas que te pueden enseñar el Madrid que no sale en las guías turísticas, así como informarte de los lugares más emblemáticos y las rutas típicas. 
Además, cerca de casa, el intercambiador de Plaza Elíptica o la Estación de Atocha te puede llevar a lugares también muy especiales y cercanos como Toledo, Alcalá de Henares o zonas más al Norte como la Sierra de Madrid.
Lugares que me encanta visitar o por los que salir a dar una caminata, sobre todo por el campo, donde procuro ir de vez en cuando. Me gusta mucho hacer escapadas a la naturaleza o pasar unos días en el pequeño pueblo de mi madre, en Ávila.

El barrio en el que vivo y trabajo, Carabanchel, me resulta muy agradable. Tiene una vida social y comunitaria interesante. Sin moverme de él puedo salir a hacer unas compras o dar cursos en los centros públicos o alternativos que existen en la zona.

Madrid, Maguerit como la denominaron los árabes, es una ciudad con mucha magia y encanto, de la que se puede gozar, sobre todo con unas pequeñas pistas y ganas de pasarlo bien.
Te espero en mi casa, de la que disfrutarás durante tu estancia.


Hi, I'm Monica!

Madrid's birth. I live and work in Madrid although I have toured countries of Europe, Central and South America and North Africa. My pending destination: Asia. I speak Spanish, Portuguese and defend me with English.

Studied Social education and Cultural Anthropology began. I lived for a time in Brazil, where studied part of this exciting race, which for the time being, I have not come to end.

I am the social intervention with homeless people, in institutional accommodations. A work which I consider interesting and from which I believe can learn a lot; Above all at the level of respect and coexistence, the treatment of people from the more human side and how solve problems from the creativity and ingenuity.

I try to meditate, try to paint and do crafts and I love dancing. I've done Oriental Dance for years, but now I have it a little abandoned. I've also taken my side more artistic afloat doing clown courses and putting in scene a character.

I really like cooking. For me and for others. I've done professional courses and enjoy teaching the preparation of typical dishes from our region, although I like to prepare recipes from anywhere in the world (at least that I know).

In my spare time I enjoy walking, visiting markets and parks of the neighborhood in which I live or having a good conversation while sipping a beer with a good top or a chocolate with ""churros"". Those ""little and big pleasures of life"", which I think that you can enjoy in Madrid, without spending much and if you know him a bit. Take a stroll through the Rastro de Madrid, go to a concert or go to the theatre.

Think I'm of those people who can teach you the Madrid which does not appear in tourist guides as well as inform you of the most emblematic places and typical routes.

In addition, close to home, the Plaza elíptica exchanger or Atocha station can take you to places nearby such as Toledo, Alcalá de Henares and areas further north as the Sierra de Madrid and also very special.
Places that I love to visit or why go to hike, especially for the field, where I try to go from time to time. I like to much make getaways to nature or spend a few days in the small village of my mother, in Avila.

District in which I live and work, Carabanchel, is very pleasant for me. It has an interesting social and community life. Without leaving him I go out to do some shopping or take courses in public or alternative centers that exist in the area.

Madrid, Maguerit as they called it the Arabs, is a city with much magic and charm, which you can enjoy, especially with some small tracks and desire to pass it well.

I hope in my house, which you can enjoy during your stay.

    Salut, je suis Monica.

Naissance de Madrid. J'habite et travaille à Madrid, bien que j'ai fait une tournée des pays d'Europe, centrale et l'Amérique du Sud et Afrique du Nord. Ma destination en attente : Asie. Je parle espagnol, portugais et me défendre avec l'anglais.

     

    Éducation sociale étudie et anthropologie culturelle a commencé. J'ai vécu pendant un certain temps au Brésil, où une partie étudiée de ce passionnant course, qui pour l'instant, je ne suis pas venu à la fin.

    Je suis l'intervention sociale auprès des sans-abri, dans accommodements institutionnels. Un travail qui me paraît intéressant et qui je crois peut apprendre beaucoup de choses ; Surtout au niveau du respect et de coexistence, le traitement de personnes côté plus humain et comment résoudre les problèmes de la créativité et l'ingéniosité.

     

    j'ai essayer de méditer, essayer de peindre et de métiers d'art et j'aime danser. J'ai fait danse est pour des années, mais maintenant je l'ai un peu abandonné. J'ai aussi pris mon côté plus artistique sous voile, faire des cours de clown et mettant en scène un personnage.

     

    J'aime vraiment cuisiner. Pour moi et pour d'autres. J'ai fait des cours de formation professionnelles et profiter de l'enseignement de la préparation de plats typiques de notre région, bien que j'aime préparer des recettes de partout dans le monde (au moins que je connais).

     

    Dans mon temps libre, j'aime marcher, visiter les marchés et les parcs du quartier dans lequel j'habite ou avoir une bonne conversation en sirotant une bière avec un bon top ou un chocolat avec des churros. Ces pequenos-grandes plaisirs de la vie, qui, je pense que vous pouvez apprécier à Madrid, sans dépenser beaucoup et si tu le connais un peu. Promenez-vous dans le Rastro de Madrid, aller à un concert ou aller au théâtre.

    Pense que je suis de ceux qui peut vous apprendre le Madrid qui n'apparaît pas dans la touristique guide ainsi que vous informe des lieux emblématiques et des itinéraires typiques.

    En outre, à proximité de la maison, l'échangeur de Plaza elíptica ou la gare d'Atocha peut vous emmener dans des endroits à proximité comme Tolède, Alcalá de Henares et zones plus au nord de la Sierra de Madrid et aussi très spécial.

    Les lieux que j'aime visiter ou pourquoi aller faire de la randonnée, en particulier pour le champ, où j'essaie d'aller de temps en temps. J'aime beaucoup escapades de rendre à la nature ou passer quelques jours dans le petit village de ma mère, à Avila.

     

    District dans lequel je vis et travaille, Carabanchel, est très agréable pour moi. Il a une vie sociale et communautaire intéressante. Sans lui laisser, je sors pour faire du shopping ou prendre des cours dans des centres publics ou alternatives qui existent dans la région.

     

    Madrid, Maguerit comme ils l'appelaient les arabes, est une ville avec beaucoup de magie et charme, que vous pouvez profiter, en particulier avec d'autres petits titres et désirez passer bien.

We welcome you to Spain and we wish you a good stay in Madrid!

Oscar works as a photographer and Vanessa is an actress and theatre producer (during 2017 I became mum, so I won't be doing check in's for a while). However, until some years ago Oscar was an engineer and Vanessa was a M&A lawyer. And then one day we decided to turn our lifes up side down and follow our real passions.

We are best friends and on May 2012 we decided to move forward and enroll in a small business together. Vanessa had been hosting with Airbnb for 2 years by then (renting the spare room at her place in Madrid/Milan and her apartment in Barcelona) and her experience (upgraded to Superhost in early 2011) was so positive that we decided we could also help other owners that don't live in town or don't have the time to rent their properties to travelers as you. And this is what we are doing now together. 

More about us, we love to travel: Vanessa has travelled 4 out of the 5 continents with a backpack that has been with her for 25 years now and enrolled in a new adventure in spring 2017: becoming a mum. Life had still not so pleasant surprises and in september 2021 she was diagnosed a breast cancer and is still in treatment. Conversely, Oscar travels by bike and closer to Madrid, so as often as he can he takes his bike for a short trip in the mountains (he's really fit!). He has also spent several summers working in France. As the business grew, we took more people on board, a lot since 2012 we must say, and each of them have left their impromt in our company. Now the team is composed by Mica, an Argentinian girl now based in Madrid for a few years, also keen on travels and on exploring new places. Mica is full of energy and we love her smiley caracter. And last but not least, Julia, who joined us in in February 2023. Julia is Mica's friend, also Argentine and has a super cool and fun vibe.

We are also keen in meeting new people and learning new things from them, but more importantly, we want you to feel at home at any of our apartments and that you feel that there's someone in town who cares for you:-) 

We enjoy little life pleasures like riding our bicycles or growing our small organic vegetables gardens, spending time with friends, our dogs and Vanessa's daughter (the only mother of the team!). We like eco-friendly environments since we care a lot about our planet. 

We will help you to find you like home in this beautiful city and we look forward to having the opportunity to meet you soon!!

Osca, Vanessa, Mica and Julia

Here are several suggestions, all less than 200 meters from LA CASA DE LUNA: If you like signature cuisine, right opposite is the Gastrobar (delicious!!). In Corredera Baja 10 I recommend Marichestnut and for a snack in the attached building there is the Italian Bookstore/Coffee Shop. Mediterranean cuisine with Arabic touches in La Mucca de Pez, with a lively terrace. There is a wonderful Argentine restaurant, La Martina, in Luna Square, and it also has midday specials and a varied menu. For lovers of Indian food, the daily special for €10 from 'Curry's' (Silva, 16) is magnificent. On that same street there are several tasty Japanese and Chinese restaurants. If you prefer the Creole flavor of New Orleans, go to Gumbo on Calle del Pez. If you're more into gourmet-type burgers with organic meat, no doubt your place is Home Burguer on Calle Luna, right by the square.

We welcome you to Spain and we wish you a good stay in Madrid!

Oscar works as a photographer and Vanessa is an actress and theatre producer (during 2017 I became mum, so I won't be doing check in's for a while). However, until some years ago Oscar was an engineer and Vanessa was a M&A lawyer. And then one day we decided to turn our lifes up side down and follow our real passions.

We are best friends and on May 2012 we decided to move forward and enroll in a small business together. Vanessa had been hosting with Airbnb for 2 years by then (renting the spare room at her place in Madrid/Milan and her apartment in Barcelona) and her experience (upgraded to Superhost in early 2011) was so positive that we decided we could also help other owners that don't live in town or don't have the time to rent their properties to travelers as you. And this is what we are doing now together. 

More about us, we love to travel: Vanessa has travelled 4 out of the 5 continents with a backpack that has been with her for 25 years now and enrolled in a new adventure in spring 2017: becoming a mum. Life had still not so pleasant surprises and in september 2021 she was diagnosed a breast cancer and is still in treatment. Conversely, Oscar travels by bike and closer to Madrid, so as often as he can he takes his bike for a short trip in the mountains (he's really fit!). He has also spent several summers working in France. As the business grew, we took more people on board, a lot since 2012 we must say, and each of them have left their impromt in our company. Now the team is composed by Mica, an Argentinian girl now based in Madrid for a few years, also keen on travels and on exploring new places. Mica is full of energy and we love her smiley caracter. And last but not least, Julia, who joined us in in February 2023. Julia is Mica's friend, also Argentine and has a super cool and fun vibe.

We are also keen in meeting new people and learning new things from them, but more importantly, we want you to feel at home at any of our apartments and that you feel that there's someone in town who cares for you:-) 

We enjoy little life pleasures like riding our bicycles or growing our small organic vegetables gardens, spending time with friends, our dogs and Vanessa's daughter (the only mother of the team!). We like eco-friendly environments since we care a lot about our planet. 

We will help you to find you like home in this beautiful city and we look forward to having the opportunity to meet you soon!!

Osca, Vanessa, Mica and Julia

We welcome you to Spain and we wish you a good stay in Madrid!

Oscar works as a photographer and Vanessa is an actress and theatre producer (during 2017 I became mum, so I won't be doing check in's for a while). However, until some years ago Oscar was an engineer and Vanessa was a M&A lawyer. And then one day we decided to turn our lifes up side down and follow our real passions.

We are best friends and on May 2012 we decided to move forward and enroll in a small business together. Vanessa had been hosting with Airbnb for 2 years by then (renting the spare room at her place in Madrid/Milan and her apartment in Barcelona) and her experience (upgraded to Superhost in early 2011) was so positive that we decided we could also help other owners that don't live in town or don't have the time to rent their properties to travelers as you. And this is what we are doing now together. 

More about us, we love to travel: Vanessa has travelled 4 out of the 5 continents with a backpack that has been with her for 25 years now and enrolled in a new adventure in spring 2017: becoming a mum. Life had still not so pleasant surprises and in september 2021 she was diagnosed a breast cancer and is still in treatment. Conversely, Oscar travels by bike and closer to Madrid, so as often as he can he takes his bike for a short trip in the mountains (he's really fit!). He has also spent several summers working in France. As the business grew, we took more people on board, a lot since 2012 we must say, and each of them have left their impromt in our company. Now the team is composed by Mica, an Argentinian girl now based in Madrid for a few years, also keen on travels and on exploring new places. Mica is full of energy and we love her smiley caracter. And last but not least, Julia, who joined us in in February 2023. Julia is Mica's friend, also Argentine and has a super cool and fun vibe.

We are also keen in meeting new people and learning new things from them, but more importantly, we want you to feel at home at any of our apartments and that you feel that there's someone in town who cares for you:-) 

We enjoy little life pleasures like riding our bicycles or growing our small organic vegetables gardens, spending time with friends, our dogs and Vanessa's daughter (the only mother of the team!). We like eco-friendly environments since we care a lot about our planet.

We welcome you to Spain and we wish you a good stay in Madrid!

Oscar works as a photographer and Vanessa is an actress and theatre producer (during 2017 I became mum, so I won't be doing check in's for a while). However, until some years ago Oscar was an engineer and Vanessa was a M&A lawyer. And then one day we decided to turn our lifes up side down and follow our real passions.

We are best friends and on May 2012 we decided to move forward and enroll in a small business together. Vanessa had been hosting with Airbnb for 2 years by then (renting the spare room at her place in Madrid/Milan and her apartment in Barcelona) and her experience (upgraded to Superhost in early 2011) was so positive that we decided we could also help other owners that don't live in town or don't have the time to rent their properties to travelers as you. And this is what we are doing now together. 

More about us, we love to travel: Vanessa has travelled 4 out of the 5 continents with a backpack that has been with her for 25 years now and enrolled in a new adventure in spring 2017: becoming a mum. Life had still not so pleasant surprises and in september 2021 she was diagnosed a breast cancer and is still in treatment. Conversely, Oscar travels by bike and closer to Madrid, so as often as he can he takes his bike for a short trip in the mountains (he's really fit!). He has also spent several summers working in France. As the business grew, we took more people on board, a lot since 2012 we must say, and each of them have left their impromt in our company. Now the team is composed by Mica, an Argentinian girl now based in Madrid for a few years, also keen on travels and on exploring new places. Mica is full of energy and we love her smiley caracter. And last but not least, Julia, who joined us in in February 2023. Julia is Mica's friend, also Argentine and has a super cool and fun vibe.

We are also keen in meeting new people and learning new things from them, but more importantly, we want you to feel at home at any of our apartments and that you feel that there's someone in town who cares for you:-) 

We enjoy little life pleasures like riding our bicycles or growing our small organic vegetables gardens, spending time with friends, our dogs and Vanessa's daughter (the only mother of the team!). We like eco-friendly environments since we care a lot about our planet. 

We will help you to find you like home in this beautiful city and we look forward to having the opportunity to meet you soon!!

Osca, Vanessa, Mica and Julia

We welcome you to Spain and we wish you a good stay in Madrid!

Oscar works as a photographer and Vanessa is an actress and theatre producer (during 2017 I became mum, so I won't be doing check in's for a while). However, until some years ago Oscar was an engineer and Vanessa was a M&A lawyer. And then one day we decided to turn our lifes up side down and follow our real passions.

We are best friends and on May 2012 we decided to move forward and enroll in a small business together. Vanessa had been hosting with Airbnb for 2 years by then (renting the spare room at her place in Madrid/Milan and her apartment in Barcelona) and her experience (upgraded to Superhost in early 2011) was so positive that we decided we could also help other owners that don't live in town or don't have the time to rent their properties to travelers as you. And this is what we are doing now together. 

More about us, we love to travel: Vanessa has travelled 4 out of the 5 continents with a backpack that has been with her for 25 years now and enrolled in a new adventure in spring 2017: becoming a mum. Life had still not so pleasant surprises and in september 2021 she was diagnosed a breast cancer and is still in treatment. Conversely, Oscar travels by bike and closer to Madrid, so as often as he can he takes his bike for a short trip in the mountains (he's really fit!). He has also spent several summers working in France. As the business grew, we took more people on board, a lot since 2012 we must say, and each of them have left their impromt in our company. Now the team is composed by Mica, an Argentinian girl now based in Madrid for a few years, also keen on travels and on exploring new places. Mica is full of energy and we love her smiley caracter. And last but not least, Julia, who joined us in in February 2023. Julia is Mica's friend, also Argentine and has a super cool and fun vibe.

We are also keen in meeting new people and learning new things from them, but more importantly, we want you to feel at home at any of our apartments and that you feel that there's someone in town who cares for you:-) 

We enjoy little life pleasures like riding our bicycles or growing our small organic vegetables gardens, spending time with friends, our dogs and Vanessa's daughter (the only mother of the team!). We like eco-friendly environments since we care a lot about our planet. 

We will help you to find you like home in this beautiful city and we look forward to having the opportunity to meet you soon!!

Osca, Vanessa, Mica and Julia

We welcome you to Spain and we wish you a good stay in Madrid!

Oscar works as a photographer and Vanessa is an actress and theatre producer (during 2017 I became mum, so I won't be doing check in's for a while). However, until some years ago Oscar was an engineer and Vanessa was a M&A lawyer. And then one day we decided to turn our lifes up side down and follow our real passions.

We are best friends and on May 2012 we decided to move forward and enroll in a small business together. Vanessa had been hosting with Airbnb for 2 years by then (renting the spare room at her place in Madrid/Milan and her apartment in Barcelona) and her experience (upgraded to Superhost in early 2011) was so positive that we decided we could also help other owners that don't live in town or don't have the time to rent their properties to travelers as you. And this is what we are doing now together. 

More about us, we love to travel: Vanessa has travelled 4 out of the 5 continents with a backpack that has been with her for 25 years now and enrolled in a new adventure in spring 2017: becoming a mum. Life had still not so pleasant surprises and in september 2021 she was diagnosed a breast cancer and is still in treatment. Conversely, Oscar travels by bike and closer to Madrid, so as often as he can he takes his bike for a short trip in the mountains (he's really fit!). He has also spent several summers working in France. As the business grew, we took more people on board, a lot since 2012 we must say, and each of them have left their impromt in our company. Now the team is composed by Mica, an Argentinian girl now based in Madrid for a few years, also keen on travels and on exploring new places. Mica is full of energy and we love her smiley caracter. And last but not least, Julia, who joined us in in February 2023. Julia is Mica's friend, also Argentine and has a super cool and fun vibe.

We are also keen in meeting new people and learning new things from them, but more importantly, we want you to feel at home at any of our apartments and that you feel that there's someone in town who cares for you:-) 

We enjoy little life pleasures like riding our bicycles or growing our small organic vegetables gardens, spending time with friends, our dogs and Vanessa's daughter (the only mother of the team!). We like eco-friendly environments since we care a lot about our planet. 

We will help you to find you like home in this beautiful city and we look forward to having the opportunity to meet you soon!!

Me pirra el cine; tooooooodos los días veo una película o dos, es lo que más me gusta hacer en la vida... Me encantan Lars Von Trier, Cronenberg, Brian de Palma, el cine policíaco italiano de los 70, el cine clásico... Súper fan del cine de culto, vamos!
